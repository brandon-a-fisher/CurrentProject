Version 14 Notes: JAN 3Oth

					 In this version I've: 
					 1. Built methods to instantiate player and obstacle objects. I've built
						conditions in these methods to control the max number of objects allowed
						in the game at a time using a constant called MAX_ACTIVE_OBJECTS.
						
					 2. Created an instance variable of type Object Array called activeObjList, 
						which will be useful to keep track of objects that have been instantiated 
						during the application run. Instantiated objects are automatically
						added to this list, and indexes for these objects are chosen by iterating
						through the indexes and appending to the first that contains null.
						
					 3. Created a test in the main method to try out these new methods.

Version 15 Notes: JAN 3Oth
					
					In this version I've:
					
					1. Edited object instantiation and deletion test.
					2. Created a printActiveObjList class to aid in test.
					
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
					 
Version 16 Notes: JAN 3Oth

					In this version I've:
					1. Cleaned up the object instantiation test and added more tests for my methods
					2. Changed a few local variable names.
					3. Created a new method to delete an object from activeObjLists
					4. Made my comments clearer.

Version 17 Notes: JAN 30th

			1. Fixed <=MAX_ACTIVE_OBJECTS to < MAX_ACTIVE_OBJECTS in if statement of instantiateObject method.
			
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Version 18 Notes: JAN 30
	
			1. Remove object method test in main method.
			2. import Player Class. Current working version
			   in my structure is PlayerWV2.java
			3. Changed any references activeObjList to activeObstacleList. It will only
			   deal with objects of Obstacle type, although for the time being I'm using 
			   Scanner as a placeholder.
			4. Changed all methods to reflect changes in program form, replacing obj
			   with obstacle.
			5. Updated comments to reflect changes
			6. Created test to test simple changes.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
			
Version 19 Notes: FEB 1st

			1. Updated printActiveObstacleList method, by removing parameters, and making
			   method only print contents of that instance variable.
			2. Updated method descriptions, and made them Java-doc compatible, as well as version description.
			3. Removed unnecessary parameter for instantiation methods.
			4. Added several new instance variables to control max objects instantiated
			   and keep track of how many objects have been instantiated.	
			5. Created new active object lists.
			6. Changed printActiveObstacleList to a method capable of printing any of the active object lists
			   called printActiveObjectList
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________			   
Version 20 Notes FEB 1ST
			1. Made addToActiveObstacleList a private method.
			2. Added addToActiveCollectibleList and addToActivePlayerList methods.
			3. Made certain instance variables plural.
			4. Removed separate methods to instantiate objects and placed them into one method
			   instantiateObject
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Version 21 Notes FEB 2nd
			1. Removed instantiateObject method. Was too complex. Replaced with makeObstacle(), makeCollectible, and makePlayer()
			   classes. These new methods take integer x and y positions as arguments.
			2. Cleaned  up implementation of printActiveObjectList.
			3. Created deleteCollectible and deletePlayer methods.
			4. Tightened whitespace.
			
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Version 22 Notes FEB 2ND

			1. Changed placeholder class for Obstacle and Collectibles from Scanner to String.
			2. Changed printActiveObjectList class implementation to include a print out of active
			   number of objects, and cleaned up implementation a bit.
			3. Commented out debuggin sections of make methods.
	
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Version 23 Notes Feb 2nd
			
			1. Created registerCollision class and functionality. At the current
			   it deletes all objects in a type specified by a string argument, but in later
			   implementation it will only delete overlapping objects. Otherwise functionality
			   seems to work properly.
			   
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Version 24 Notes Feb 3rd

			1. Updated some implementation comments.
			2. Created MAX_OBJECTS_GAME instance variable.
			3. Started game run algorithm in main method.
			4. Created getPlayer(), getCollectible() and getObstacle() functions.


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Version 25 Notes Feb 3rd

			1. Overhauled registerCollison() so that now its registerCollsionPlayer() and handles
			   collisions with players for demo 1.
			2. Removed debug else in make methods.
			3. Made properly javaDoc compatible.

  /** 
	*Version 26 Feb 3rd
	* 1. Adjusted comments in registerPlayerCollision to 
	* 	 better describe process.
	* 2. Created get****Length methods to return integer
	*    representing the length of a particular active 
	*	 Object list to aid in overlap methods in other
	*    classes.
	*/
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________	

/** 
	*Version 27 Feb 3rd
	* 1. Removed all references to Obstacles and Collectibles being treated as Strings. The proper
	*    object types: Obstacle and Collectible are now returned.
	*/
	
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 /** 
	*Version 27_2 Feb 3rd
	* 1. Fixed a logic error in delete methods where it was possible to
	*	 decrement numActiveObject variables below 0 by using the method
	*	 on null indexes.
	* 2. Fixed another error in delete methods where you could specify an
	* 	 index out of range without warning.
	*/

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________	
/**
Version 27_3 February 4th
1. added stepThroughActive method to retrieve indexes
   of active objects and put them in a list.
