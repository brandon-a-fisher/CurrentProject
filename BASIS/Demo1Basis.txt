For the demo one our project will follow these basic guidelines.

1. Instantiated objects will move along the ground from right to left.

2. When an instantiated obstacle hits the edge of the screen or collides with
   the player character, it is deleted and removed from its corresponding active 
   object list.
   
3. The screen will consist of x and y nodes ranging (widthxlength)=(3x10).
   Or 30 units. 0 will be at the top left corner of the grid.
 
4. Every object is the size of one node, and if the nodes overlap a collision is
   registered.
   
5. Minimum output will just display positions of instantiated objects, and if there
   are collisions. If time permits Brandon will create a simple text-graphic interface.

6. Objects will be instantiated on a random basis with a cap controlling how many can apper
   onscreen at once.
   
7. When the player character collides with an obstacle its health attribute will diminish. A
   text output will keep track of this, and if the character runs out of health a game over
   will be initiated, ending the program.
